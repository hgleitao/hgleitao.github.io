Research experience
======
<b>Honours Project - University of Glasgow</b> (Glasgow, UK, 8/19 - 3/20) - <i>in progress</i>

<b>Investigating the genetic basis of ventral colouration in common lizards</b>. Analysed and quantified ventral colouration from field-collected specimens of different colour morphs; extracted RNA from ventral scales, carrying out troubleshooting to increase the efficacy of this method; ran quality control of raw sequencing data; bioinformatically analysed the produced RNA-seq data with the use of large computing clusters; performed an RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis; prepared samples for transmission electron microscopy and subsequently characterised differences in pigmentation cell patterns between individuals; prepared project reports and presentations.

<b>MSci Project - Uppsala University</b> (Uppsala, Sweden, 7/18 - 7/19)

<b>Recovering microbial, dietary, and host information from historical dental calculus of non-human mammals</b>. Sampled dental calculus from museum-preserved and archaeological specimens; extracted DNA from highly sensitive samples in a dedicated ancient DNA laboratory; prepared next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries, quantifying and characterizing them, ensuring that they could be submitted for NGS; bioinformatically analysed the produced metagenomic data with the use of large computing clusters, standard and novel analytical tools; prepared project reports, manuscripts, and posters; received a competitive scholarship to present my work at a conference (SMBE19).

<b>Field Assistant - University of Glasgow</b> (Carinthia, Austria, 5/16 - 7/18)

Three fieldwork seasons (seven months in total) for a research project studying the evolutionary history and genetics of viviparity in the reproductively bimodal common lizards (Zootoca vivipara). Skills involved: lizard capture, design and execution of behavioural experiments, tissue sampling, morphometric data collection and recording, extraction and fixation of embryos from eggshells, spectrophotometry, husbandry.

<b>Field Assistant - The Chinese University of Hong Kong</b> (Hong Kong, 2/17 - 4/17)

Fieldwork for a research project studying the spatial distribution of genetic diversity among atyid shrimp species in Hong Kong. Collected samples, measured environmental parameters, GPS localisation and mapping, data recording.
